**You:**


I want to write a chatgpt like app where you can ask things and it will run a local LLM (large language model) and try to answer the question using varios tools.
Search, Calculator etc.

The LLM will take a base prompt like this
"Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

search: a search engine. useful for when you need to answer questions about current
        events. input should be a search query.
calculator: useful for getting the result of a math expression. The input to this
            tool should be a valid mathematical expression that could be executed
            by a simple calculator.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [search, calculator]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin!

Question: ${question}
Thought:
"

That should be read from a file and interpolate the question.
the code will ask the LLM to generate a response, parse the action and action input. Run the action with the inputs. The result will be the observation.
If the result is the final answer it will print it, otherwise it will update the prompt to include this new observation and provide that new prompt to the LLM.
This will run in a loop until the answer is found.

I want to write this code in ruby.
I want to be able to define multiple tools that can be added to the base prompt. Currently only search and calculator works but the code make it easy to add new tools.
The LLM also should be abstracted away so we can swap multiple ways of running an LLM (chatgpt via API, local LLMs, etc). We will start with an LLM that is local but should be able to be swapped.
Let start with defining the main classes that we are going to use.


------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Sure! Let's start by defining the main classes that we'll be using for your chatbot application in Ruby. Here's an initial implementation:
```ruby
class Tool
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def execute(input)
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement 'execute' method"
  end
end

class SearchTool < Tool
  def execute(input)
    # Code to perform search using a search engine
    # Return the search results
  end
end

class CalculatorTool < Tool
  def execute(input)
    # Code to evaluate the mathematical expression
    # Return the result
  end
end

class LanguageModel
  attr_reader :prompt

  def initialize(prompt)
    @prompt = prompt
  end

  def generate_response
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement 'generate_response' method"
  end
end

class LocalLanguageModel < LanguageModel
  def generate_response
    # Code to generate response using a local language model
    # Return the generated response
  end
end

```
In this initial implementation, we have two main classes: `Tool` and `LanguageModel`. The `Tool` class represents a tool that can be used to perform certain actions, such as searching or calculating. It has a `name` attribute and an `execute` method that will be implemented by its subclasses.
Currently, we have two subclasses of `Tool` defined: `SearchTool` and `CalculatorTool`. These subclasses represent the search and calculator tools, respectively. In their `execute` methods, you can implement the logic to perform the search or calculation using the appropriate tools.
The `LanguageModel` class represents the language model that will generate the responses. It has a `prompt` attribute and a `generate_response` method that will be implemented by its subclasses.
In this initial implementation, we have a subclass of `LanguageModel` called `LocalLanguageModel`. This subclass represents a local language model that will be used for generating responses. In its `generate_response` method, you can implement the logic to generate a response using the local language model.
This provides a basic structure for your chatbot application, where you have the tools defined as subclasses of `Tool` and the language model defined as subclasses of `LanguageModel`. You can extend this implementation by adding more tools or implementing different language models as per your requirements.

------------------
**You:**

ok. give me the command to write this classes into their own files using zsh
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! Here are the commands to create separate files for each of the classes using the Zsh shell:
1. Create a file named `tool.rb` for the `Tool` class:
```shell
echo "class Tool
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def execute(input)
    raise NotImplementedError, \"Subclasses must implement 'execute' method\"
  end
end" > tool.rb

```
1. Create a file named `search_tool.rb` for the `SearchTool` class:
```shell
echo "require_relative 'tool'

class SearchTool < Tool
  def execute(input)
    # Code to perform search using a search engine
    # Return the search results
  end
end" > search_tool.rb

```
1. Create a file named `calculator_tool.rb` for the `CalculatorTool` class:
```shell
echo "require_relative 'tool'

class CalculatorTool < Tool
  def execute(input)
    # Code to evaluate the mathematical expression
    # Return the result
  end
end" > calculator_tool.rb

```
1. Create a file named `language_model.rb` for the `LanguageModel` class:
```shell
echo "class LanguageModel
  attr_reader :prompt

  def initialize(prompt)
    @prompt = prompt
  end

  def generate_response
    raise NotImplementedError, \"Subclasses must implement 'generate_response' method\"
  end
end" > language_model.rb

```
1. Create a file named `local_language_model.rb` for the `LocalLanguageModel` class:
```shell
echo "require_relative 'language_model'

class LocalLanguageModel < LanguageModel
  def generate_response
    # Code to generate response using a local language model
    # Return the generated response
  end
end" > local_language_model.rb

```
After running these commands, you will have separate files for each of the classes with the provided code. Make sure to adjust the file names and paths according to your project structure if needed.

------------------
**You:**


move the tools into their own dir
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! Here are the updated commands to create separate directories for the tools and move the corresponding files into their respective directories:
1. Create a directory named `tools`:
```shell
mkdir tools

```
1. Move the `tool.rb` file into the `tools` directory:
```shell
mv tool.rb tools/

```
1. Create a file named `search_tool.rb` for the `SearchTool` class inside the `tools` directory:
```shell
echo "require_relative '../tool'

class SearchTool < Tool
  def execute(input)
    # Code to perform search using a search engine
    # Return the search results
  end
end" > tools/search_tool.rb

```
1. Create a file named `calculator_tool.rb` for the `CalculatorTool` class inside the `tools` directory:
```shell
echo "require_relative '../tool'

class CalculatorTool < Tool
  def execute(input)
    # Code to evaluate the mathematical expression
    # Return the result
  end
end" > tools/calculator_tool.rb

```
By executing these updated commands, you will have the `tools` directory created with the `search_tool.rb` and `calculator_tool.rb` files inside it. The `tool.rb` file will remain in the main directory. Make sure to adjust the file paths and directory names as per your project structure if needed.

------------------
**You:**


what is next?
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Next, we can proceed with creating files for the remaining classes and organizing them into appropriate directories. Here's the updated set of commands:
1. Create a directory named `language_models`:
```shell
mkdir language_models

```
1. Move the `language_model.rb` file into the `language_models` directory:
```shell
mv language_model.rb language_models/

```
1. Create a file named `local_language_model.rb` for the `LocalLanguageModel` class inside the `language_models` directory:
```shell
echo "require_relative '../language_model'

class LocalLanguageModel < LanguageModel
  def generate_response
    # Code to generate response using a local language model
    # Return the generated response
  end
end" > language_models/local_language_model.rb

```
Now, you should have the following directory structure:
```markdown
- tools/
  - tool.rb
  - search_tool.rb
  - calculator_tool.rb
- language_models/
  - language_model.rb
  - local_language_model.rb

```
Each class is placed in its respective directory to maintain a clean and organized structure.
After organizing the files, you can proceed with implementing the logic within each class according to your requirements. Remember to adjust the file paths and directory names if necessary.

------------------
**You:**


ok. let summarize that we have so we can create a new ChatGPT prompt to continue solving this problem
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! Let's summarize what we have so far:
Directory structure:
```markdown
- tools/
  - tool.rb
  - search_tool.rb
  - calculator_tool.rb
- language_models/
  - language_model.rb
  - local_language_model.rb

```
Class structure:
In `tool.rb`:
```ruby
class Tool
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def execute(input)
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement 'execute' method"
  end
end

```
In `search_tool.rb`:
```ruby
require_relative 'tool'

class SearchTool < Tool
  def execute(input)
    # Code to perform search using a search engine
    # Return the search results
  end
end

```
In `calculator_tool.rb`:
```ruby
require_relative 'tool'

class CalculatorTool < Tool
  def execute(input)
    # Code to evaluate the mathematical expression
    # Return the result
  end
end

```
In `language_model.rb`:
```ruby
class LanguageModel
  attr_reader :prompt

  def initialize(prompt)
    @prompt = prompt
  end

  def generate_response
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement 'generate_response' method"
  end
end

```
In `local_language_model.rb`:
```ruby
require_relative 'language_model'

class LocalLanguageModel < LanguageModel
  def generate_response
    # Code to generate response using a local language model
    # Return the generated response
  end
end

```
With these classes and the directory structure in place, you can proceed to create a new ChatGPT prompt and continue building the logic for your application.

------------------
**You:**


ok, so we have the main utility classes. We need to create the base class where we will connect all of this. Create this class and name it appropriately 
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! Let's create a base class that connects all the utility classes together. We'll name it `ChatbotApp`. Here's an initial implementation:
```ruby
class ChatbotApp
  attr_reader :tools, :language_model

  def initialize
    @tools = []
    @language_model = nil
  end

  def add_tool(tool)
    @tools << tool
  end

  def set_language_model(language_model)
    @language_model = language_model
  end

  def run(question)
    prompt = "Question: #{question}\nThought:"

    loop do
      response = generate_response(prompt)
      action, action_input = parse_action(response)
      observation = perform_action(action, action_input)
      prompt += "\nThought: #{response}\nAction: #{action}\nAction Input: #{action_input}\nObservation: #{observation}"

      if observation.start_with?("Final Answer:")
        puts observation
        break
      end
    end
  end

  def generate_response(prompt)
    @language_model.generate_response(prompt)
  end

  def parse_action(response)
    # Parse the response to extract the action and action input
    # Return action, action_input
  end

  def perform_action(action, action_input)
    tool = @tools.find { |t| t.name == action }
    tool.execute(action_input)
  end
end

```
In this `ChatbotApp` class, we have an `initialize` method that sets up empty arrays for storing the tools and a `nil` reference for the language model.
The `add_tool` method allows you to add tools to the `tools` array. The `set_language_model` method sets the language model for the chatbot application.
The `run` method is the main method that runs the chatbot. It takes a question as input and initializes the `prompt`. It then enters a loop where it generates a response using the language model, parses the action and action input from the response, performs the action using the appropriate tool, and updates the prompt with the thought, action, action input, and observation.
The `generate_response` method delegates to the language model to generate a response.
The `parse_action` method should be implemented to parse the action and action input from the response generated by the language model. You'll need to define the specific parsing logic based on your desired response format.
The `perform_action` method looks for the appropriate tool based on the action and calls the `execute` method of that tool with the action input.
This `ChatbotApp` class serves as the core of your chatbot application, connecting the tools and the language model together to provide a conversational experience.

------------------
**You:**


make it so the tools and llm are provided in the initialize. they cannot be updated once the chatbot is initiailized. 
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Sure! Let's update the `ChatbotApp` class to take the tools and the language model as arguments in the `initialize` method. Here's the modified implementation:
```ruby
class ChatbotApp
  attr_reader :tools, :language_model

  def initialize(tools, language_model)
    @tools = tools
    @language_model = language_model
  end

  def run(question)
    prompt = "Question: #{question}\nThought:"

    loop do
      response = generate_response(prompt)
      action, action_input = parse_action(response)
      observation = perform_action(action, action_input)
      prompt += "\nThought: #{response}\nAction: #{action}\nAction Input: #{action_input}\nObservation: #{observation}"

      if observation.start_with?("Final Answer:")
        puts observation
        break
      end
    end
  end

  def generate_response(prompt)
    @language_model.generate_response(prompt)
  end

  def parse_action(response)
    # Parse the response to extract the action and action input
    # Return action, action_input
  end

  def perform_action(action, action_input)
    tool = @tools.find { |t| t.name == action }
    tool.execute(action_input)
  end
end

```
Now, when creating an instance of the `ChatbotApp` class, you can provide the tools and language model as arguments to the `initialize` method. Once the chatbot is initialized, the tools and language model cannot be updated.
Here's an example of how you can create an instance of `ChatbotApp`:
```ruby
# Create tools
search_tool = SearchTool.new("search")
calculator_tool = CalculatorTool.new("calculator")

# Create language model
local_language_model = LocalLanguageModel.new

# Create the chatbot app instance
chatbot = ChatbotApp.new([search_tool, calculator_tool], local_language_model)

```
In this example, we create instances of `SearchTool` and `CalculatorTool` as the tools, and an instance of `LocalLanguageModel` as the language model. These instances are then passed as arguments to the `initialize` method of `ChatbotApp` to create the chatbot application instance.
By organizing the initialization in this way, the tools and language model are set at the start and cannot be updated later, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the chatbot application.

------------------
**You:**


ok. lets create some tests to make sure the main loop works. mock the llm and the tools
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Sure! Let's create some test cases to verify that the main loop of the `ChatbotApp` works correctly. We'll use mocks to simulate the behavior of the language model and tools. Here's an example implementation using the RSpec testing framework:
```ruby
require 'rspec'
require 'rspec/mocks'

RSpec.describe ChatbotApp do
  let(:search_tool) { double('SearchTool') }
  let(:calculator_tool) { double('CalculatorTool') }
  let(:local_language_model) { double('LocalLanguageModel') }

  subject(:chatbot) { ChatbotApp.new([search_tool, calculator_tool], local_language_model) }

  before do
    allow(search_tool).to receive(:name).and_return('search')
    allow(calculator_tool).to receive(:name).and_return('calculator')
  end

  describe '#run' do
    let(:question) { 'What is the capital of France?' }
    let(:response1) { 'search' }
    let(:action_input1) { 'capital of France' }
    let(:observation1) { 'Paris' }
    let(:response2) { 'calculator' }
    let(:action_input2) { '2 + 2' }
    let(:observation2) { '4' }
    let(:response3) { 'search' }
    let(:action_input3) { 'population of France' }
    let(:observation3) { '67 million' }
    let(:response4) { 'Final Answer: Paris is the capital of France.' }

    it 'runs the main loop and finds the final answer' do
      expect(local_language_model).to receive(:generate_response).and_return(response1, response2, response3, response4)
      expect(search_tool).to receive(:execute).with(action_input1).and_return(observation1)
      expect(calculator_tool).to receive(:execute).with(action_input2).and_return(observation2)
      expect(search_tool).to receive(:execute).with(action_input3).and_return(observation3)
      expect { chatbot.run(question) }.to output(/Final Answer: Paris is the capital of France./).to_stdout
    end
  end
end

```
In this test case, we define a set of responses, action inputs, and observations for each interaction in the main loop. We set up expectations using RSpec's mocking functionality to specify the behavior of the language model and tools.
The `before` block sets up the mocks for the tools, allowing them to respond with their respective names when the `name` method is called.
Inside the `it` block, we set the expectations for the language model's `generate_response` method and the tools' `execute` methods, specifying the expected arguments and return values.
Finally, we use the `expect { ... }.to output(...).to_stdout` syntax to capture the output of `puts` statements in the `run` method and verify that the final answer is correctly printed.
You can run the test using RSpec:
```shell
rspec spec/chatbot_app_spec.rb

```
Make sure to adjust the test case according to your specific implementation, including the method names, input/output formats, and any additional logic you have in the main loop.

------------------
**You:**


NameError:
  uninitialized constant ChatbotApp
# ./spec/chatbot_app_spec.rb:4:in `<top (required)>'
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `ChatbotApp` class is not being loaded correctly in the test file. To resolve this issue, you need to require the `chatbot_app.rb` file at the beginning of your test file. Here's the updated test file:
```ruby
require 'rspec'
require 'rspec/mocks'
require_relative '../chatbot_app'

RSpec.describe ChatbotApp do
  # Rest of the code remains the same
end

```
Please make sure that the `chatbot_app.rb` file is in the same directory as your test file, or update the relative path accordingly.
Once you've made this change, you can run the test using RSpec:
```shell
rspec spec/chatbot_app_spec.rb

```
This should resolve the `uninitialized constant ChatbotApp` error and allow the test to execute correctly.

------------------
**You:**


Failures:

------------------
**ChatGPT:**


I apologize for the oversight. The error message indicates that the `perform_action` method is receiving `nil` as the tool object. This issue might be occurring because the tool is not set correctly in the test setup.
To fix this issue, we need to set up the tool mocks to return the correct tool objects when calling the `find` method in the `perform_action` method. Here's the updated test setup:
```ruby
# ...

before do
  allow(search_tool).to receive(:name).and_return('search')
  allow(calculator_tool).to receive(:name).and_return('calculator')
end

describe '#run' do
  let(:question) { 'What is the capital of France?' }
  let(:response1) { 'search' }
  let(:action_input1) { 'capital of France' }
  let(:observation1) { 'Paris' }
  let(:response2) { 'calculator' }
  let(:action_input2) { '2 + 2' }
  let(:observation2) { '4' }
  let(:response3) { 'search' }
  let(:action_input3) { 'population of France' }
  let(:observation3) { '67 million' }
  let(:response4) { 'Final Answer: Paris is the capital of France.' }

  it 'runs the main loop and finds the final answer' do
    expect(local_language_model).to receive(:generate_response).and_return(response1, response2, response3, response4)
    expect(search_tool).to receive(:execute).with(action_input1).and_return(observation1)
    expect(calculator_tool).to receive(:execute).with(action_input2).and_return(observation2)
    expect(search_tool).to receive(:execute).with(action_input3).and_return(observation3)

    chatbot.add_tool(search_tool)
    chatbot.add_tool(calculator_tool)
    chatbot.run(question)
  end
end

# ...

```
In this updated code, we add the `search_tool` and `calculator_tool` to the `chatbot` instance using the `add_tool` method. This ensures that the tools are available within the `perform_action` method when calling the `execute` method.
Please update your test file with this change and run the test again using RSpec. The error should be resolved, and the test should pass successfully.

------------------
**You:**


lets go back to the implementation of chatbot_app. lets add some logging to see what is going on.  Use a logger and use color to identify what is going on
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! Let's update the `ChatbotApp` class to incorporate logging using a logger library. We'll also use colors to differentiate different types of log messages. For this example, we'll use the `colorize` gem to add color to the log messages. Here's the modified implementation:
```ruby
require 'colorize'

class ChatbotApp
  attr_reader :tools, :language_model, :logger

  def initialize(tools, language_model)
    @tools = tools
    @language_model = language_model
    @logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
    @logger.formatter = proc do |severity, datetime, _progname, msg|
      colorized_msg = case severity
                      when 'INFO'
                        msg.green
                      when 'WARN'
                        msg.yellow
                      when 'ERROR'
                        msg.red
                      else
                        msg
                      end
      "[#{datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] #{severity}: #{colorized_msg}\n"
    end
  end

  def run(question)
    prompt = "Question: #{question}\nThought:"

    loop do
      response = generate_response(prompt)
      action, action_input = parse_action(response)
      log_info("Received response: #{response}")
      log_info("Action: #{action}")
      log_info("Action Input: #{action_input}")
      observation = perform_action(action, action_input)
      prompt += "\nThought: #{response}\nAction: #{action}\nAction Input: #{action_input}\nObservation: #{observation}"
      log_info("Observation: #{observation}")

      if observation.start_with?("Final Answer:")
        log_info("Final Answer: #{observation}", color: :cyan)
        break
      end
    end
  end

  def generate_response(prompt)
    @language_model.generate_response(prompt)
  end

  def parse_action(response)
    # Parse the response to extract the action and action input
    # Return action, action_input
  end

  def perform_action(action, action_input)
    tool = @tools.find { |t| t.name == action }
    result = tool&amp;.execute(action_input)
    result.nil? ? log_error("Failed to execute action: #{action}") : result
  end

  private

  def log_info(message, color: nil)
    log_message(message, :info, color)
  end

  def log_error(message, color: nil)
    log_message(message, :error, color)
  end

  def log_message(message, severity, color)
    colored_message = color.nil? ? message : message.send(color)
    @logger.send(severity.downcase.to_sym, colored_message)
  end
end

```
In this updated implementation, we use the `Logger` class to handle logging. We set the logger's formatter to customize the log messages by adding timestamps and applying colors based on severity levels. We define `log_info`, `log_error`, and `log_message` as helper methods to simplify logging with different severity levels and colors.
To use the `ChatbotApp` class, you can create an instance and provide the tools and language model as before. The logging messages will be outputted to the console with the specified colors based on the severity level.
Feel free to customize the colors or logging behavior according to your preferences and requirements.

------------------
**You:**


lets move the Logger code to its owne class. also when calling the logger do so directly like 'logger.info(msg)', the caller decides the color of the msg
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! Let's extract the logger functionality into its own class, and update the `ChatbotApp` class to use the new logger class. We'll modify the `ChatbotApp` class to pass log messages to the logger class, and the caller can decide the color of the message. Here's the updated implementation:
```ruby
class Logger
  def info(message)
    log_message(message, :info)
  end

  def warn(message)
    log_message(message, :warn)
  end

  def error(message)
    log_message(message, :error)
  end

  private

  def log_message(message, severity)
    puts "[#{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] #{severity.to_s.upcase}: #{message}"
  end
end

class ChatbotApp
  attr_reader :tools, :language_model, :logger

  def initialize(tools, language_model)
    @tools = tools
    @language_model = language_model
    @logger = Logger.new
  end

In this updated code, we introduce the `Logger` class, which is responsible for logging messages to the console. We define three logging methods: `info`, `warn`, and `error`, which respectively output the messages with the severity levels "INFO", "WARN", and "ERROR" to the console.
In the `ChatbotApp` class, we create an instance of the `Logger` class and use it for logging purposes. We call the logger's methods directly, passing the log messages as arguments.
By separating the logger functionality into its own class, we provide a more flexible and decoupled design. The caller of the logger (in this case, the `ChatbotApp` class) can decide when and how to log messages and can also decide the color of the messages.
Feel free to further customize the logger class or the logging behavior to meet your specific requirements.

**You:**


need to add some more logging. log the main prompt, the generated response
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! Let's update the `ChatbotApp` class to include additional logging for the main prompt and the generated response. We'll modify the `run` method to log these messages. Here's the updated implementation:
```ruby
class ChatbotApp
  # ...

  def run(question)
    prompt = "Question: #{question}\nThought:"

    logger.info("Main Prompt: #{prompt}")

    loop do
      response = generate_response(prompt)
      action, action_input = parse_action(response)

      logger.info("Generated Response: #{response}")
      logger.info("Action: #{action}")
      logger.info("Action Input: #{action_input}")

      observation = perform_action(action, action_input)

      prompt += "\nThought: #{response}\nAction: #{action}\nAction Input: #{action_input}\nObservation: #{observation}"
      logger.info("Observation: #{observation}")

      if observation.start_with?("Final Answer:")
        logger.info("Final Answer: #{observation}".cyan)
        break
      end
    end
  end

  # ...
end

```
In this updated code, we added the `logger.info` calls at appropriate points in the `run` method. We log the main prompt using the `logger.info("Main Prompt: #{prompt}")` statement. Additionally, we log the generated response using the `logger.info("Generated Response: #{response}")` statement.
By logging the main prompt and the generated response, you can have a clearer view of the conversation flow and the model's responses.
Feel free to customize the logging messages or add more logging statements as needed for your specific requirements.

------------------
**You:**


change the code of the logger to use an actual ruby Logger class
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Sure, here's an updated implementation of the `Logger` class that uses the built-in Ruby `Logger` class:
```ruby
require 'logger'

class ChatbotLogger
  COLORS = {
    :red => 31,
    :green => 32,
    :yellow => 33,
    :blue => 34,
    :pink => 35,
    :light_blue => 36
  }

  def initialize(logdev = STDOUT)
    @logger = Logger.new(logdev)
    @logger.formatter = proc { |severity, datetime, progname, msg|
      "#{datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')} #{colorize(severity, severity.to_s.upcase)}: #{msg}\n"
    }
  end

  def colorize(color, text)
    "\e[#{COLORS[color]}m#{text}\e[0m"
  end

  def info(msg)
    @logger.info(msg)
  end

  def warn(msg)
    @logger.warn(msg)
  end

  def error(msg)
    @logger.error(msg)
  end
end

```
With this implementation, you can create a new logger instance and call `info`, `warn`, or `error` on it, passing in the message as a string. The message will be logged with a timestamp and the specified severity level, with color formatting applied to the severity level.

**You:**


oh I see the issue now. We have not implemented the `parse_action(response)` in the chatbot_app
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Apologies for the oversight. Let's implement the `parse_action` method in the `ChatbotApp` class. Here's an updated version:
```ruby
class ChatbotApp
  # ...

  def parse_action(response)
    lines = response.split("\n")
    action = nil
    action_input = nil

    lines.each do |line|
      line.strip!
      if line.start_with?('Action:')
        action = line.gsub('Action:', '').strip
      elsif line.start_with?('Action Input:')
        action_input = line.gsub('Action Input:', '').strip
      end
    end

    [action, action_input]
  end

  # ...
end

```
In this implementation, we split the response into lines and iterate through each line. We check if the line starts with 'Action:' or 'Action Input:' and extract the corresponding values by removing the prefix and trimming any leading or trailing whitespace. We then return the action and action input as an array.
Now, when the response is parsed using the `parse_action` method, the action and action input will be correctly extracted from the response string.
Please update the `ChatbotApp` class with this code, and it should resolve the issue.

------------------
**You:**


ok, so based on that please regenerate the base spec for run
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! Here's the regenerated base spec for the `run` method in the `ChatbotApp` class:
```ruby
RSpec.describe ChatbotApp do
  let(:mockTools) { [MockTool.new('search'), MockTool.new('calculator')] }
  let(:mockLanguageModel) { MockLanguageModel.new }

  describe '#run' do
    it 'runs the main loop and finds the final answer' do
      question = 'What is the capital of France?'

      chatbot = ChatbotApp.new(mockTools, mockLanguageModel)
      expect(chatbot).to receive(:generate_response).and_return(
        "Answer: I'm not sure. Let me search for it.\nAction: search\nAction Input: capital of France",
        "Answer: Paris is the capital of France.\nAction: Final Answer"
      )

      expect { chatbot.run(question) }.to output(/Final Answer: Paris is the capital of France./).to_stdout
    end
  end
end

```
In this regenerated spec, we have updated the expectation for the `generate_response` method to return a sequence of responses. The first response simulates the search action, and the second response simulates the final answer action. The `run` method is expected to output the final answer to STDOUT.
Please replace the existing `describe '#run'` block in your spec file with this updated code, and it should test the main loop behavior correctly.

In this updated spec, the `generate_response` method of the language model is expected to return the thought process and actions. We mock the `search_tool` to execute the action and return the corresponding observation. The final answer is expected to be printed to STDOUT.
Please replace the existing spec with this updated code, and it should accurately test the `run` method based on the provided spec file.

**ChatGPT:**


Based on the provided logs and the `run` implementation, it appears that the issue lies in the `perform_action` method. The error message indicates that an invalid action is being passed to the method.
To address this, we need to update the `perform_action` method in the `ChatbotApp` class. Currently, it doesn't handle the case when the action is empty or nil. We can add a condition to check for this and return an appropriate default value.
Here's an updated version of the `perform_action` method:
```ruby
class ChatbotApp
  # ...

  def perform_action(action, action_input)
    if action.nil? || action.empty?
      logger.error('Invalid action: missing or empty')
      return ''  # Return a default empty value
    end

    # Handle the action based on its type
    case action
    when 'search'
      search_tool.execute(action_input)
    when 'calculator'
      calculator_tool.execute(action_input)
    else
      logger.error("Invalid action: #{action}")
      ''  # Return a default empty value
    end
  end

  # ...
end

```
In this updated implementation, we first check if the action is nil or empty. If so, we log an error and return an empty string as a default value.
Please replace the existing `perform_action` method in your code with this updated version, and it should resolve the issue.
